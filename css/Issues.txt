Problem: the animated tags on the "about me" and "contact" are not positioned correctly. On all browsers.

solution: - center them to create more space. Remove the left margin that was in place
          - Expand size of grid items from 7rem to 7.5rem.  
                -All this makes enough room for the animation to fit without going to the next line


Problem: Contact page inputs dont shrink enough on Firefox when the wnidow gets smaller.  Min-width: 0; does nothing.

Solution: - make the contact form a flexbox
          - add bottom margins to create proper spacing
          - delete all breaks from contact.html to fix spacing issues in all browsers other than Firefox
