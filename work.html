          <h2>Who's That Pokemon App</h2>
          <p>This is an app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches data from the PokeAPI and displays a list of Pokemon based on which generation the Pokemon is from.
            A Pokemon may be selected which will bring up a modal full of additional information about the chosen Pokemon, as well as giving the option 
            to view the previous or the next Pokemon in the list. <br>
            With this project I learned about the basics of JavaScript as well as DOM Interaction, AJAX, Bootstrap a little bit of JQuery, and a bit about debugging

          <h2>myFlix API</h2>
          <p>In this project I built an API from scratch using node.js with express that will serve as the backend to the myFlix app.
            It allows users to log-in, view information about movies, genres, and directors in the database, and allows them to make a list of their favorite movies. <br>
            In this project I learned about node.js, express, mongoose, and NoSQL database MongoDB. I also learned about hosting my backend on Heroku.

          <h2>myFlix Client</h2>
          <p>This is a front-end project for a movie app that allows users to create an account, log-in, update information and view movies from a database.
            The backend of this project is the myFlix API that I built and the frontend uses the React framework. <br>
            I learned about various parts of the React framework when building this project, such as states, props, and components.  I also learned about
            how React uses a virtual DOM when rendering parts of the page.  Styling for this project was done with React Bootstrap as well as some custom CSS.

          <h2>Meet App</h2>
          <p>This is Progressive Web App that loads data from an external API, Google Calendars in this case, and loads a list of events.
            The events listed can be filtered based on location and the number of events viewed at a given time can be adjusted by the user.
            Charts at the top of the page will adjust to show information based on the events currently listed. <br>

            Building this app took me through the process of setting up serverless using Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
            and how to make data on in the app available to users when they have no Internet access.  This was built in the React framework and 
            uses CSS for styling.  Charts were created using the Recharts library.
